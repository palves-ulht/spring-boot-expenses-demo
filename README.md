# Expense Tracker

A Spring Boot application that manages personal expenses. It provides an API for the expenses flutter app.

## Running from docker (quickest)

Download docker-compose.yml (located at the root of the project)

Inside the folder with that file, run
```
docker-compose up
```

## Running from Intellij

* Install mysql
* Create the expenses database (see below)
* Import the project into Intellij. Since this is a maven project, it should configure everything automatically
* Go to the ExpensesDemoApplication.kt and run main

### Setup database
```
create database expenses;

create user 'expenses'@'localhost' identified by 'passwordexpenses';

grant all privileges on expenses.* to 'expenses'@'localhost';
```

## Technical notes

### Spring Security

There are two controllers with different security needs (web and api). See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ2muJniikY for a good explanation
of spring security.
